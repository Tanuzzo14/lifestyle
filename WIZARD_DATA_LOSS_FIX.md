# Wizard Data Loss Fix - Documentation

## Problem Statement

After starting the wizard (configurazione guidata) following user registration, the following critical user data fields were being lost:
- `uid` - User's unique identifier
- `passwordHash` - Hashed password
- `createdBy` - Creator's UID (for non-pro users only)

This was causing data inconsistencies where users would lose their authentication credentials and creator tracking information after completing the wizard steps.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Issue
When a user registered and entered the wizard flow, the following sequence occurred:

1. **Registration** (`register()` function in index.html, line 1021-1043):
   - User data was created in data.json with all required fields (uid, passwordHash, createdBy)
   - State variables were set: `state.uid`, `state.username`, `state.userType`, `state.isAuthenticated`
   - **BUT** `loadUserData()` was NOT called
   - Wizard view was set and rendered

2. **Wizard Steps** (e.g., `saveMeasurements()` at line 1536):
   - User adds measurements, habits, workout plans, etc.
   - Each action calls `saveAppState()` to persist data

3. **saveAppState()** function (line 789-850):
   - Tries to preserve `createdBy` and `passwordHash` from `state` object (lines 800-808):
     ```javascript
     if (state.createdBy) {
       payload.createdBy = state.createdBy;
     }
     if (state.passwordHash) {
       payload.passwordHash = state.passwordHash;
     }
     ```
   - **Problem**: These fields were never loaded into `state` because `loadUserData()` wasn't called
   - Result: The fields get overwritten with undefined/null values

### Why It Happened
The `loadUserData()` function (line 852-950) is responsible for:
- Loading user data from data.json
- Populating the `state` object with ALL user fields, including:
  - `state.createdBy` (line 892)
  - `state.passwordHash` (line 893)
  - `state.data` (application data)
  - `state.userType`
  - `state.sleepStartTimestamp`

After login, `loadUserData()` was correctly called (line 1008), so logged-in users didn't experience this issue. However, after registration, it was missing, causing new users to lose data during the wizard flow.

## Solution

### The Fix
Add a single line to call `loadUserData()` after successful registration, before entering the wizard:

**File: index.html, line 1030**
```javascript
register: async function(username, password, userType = "user") {
  const result = await Auth.register(username, password, userType, displayError);
  
  if (result) {
    state.username = result.username;
    state.uid = result.uid;
    state.userType = result.userType;
    state.isAuthenticated = true;
    
    await loadUserData();  // ← ADDED THIS LINE
    
    if (userType === "pro") {
      redirectToProDashboard();
      return;
    }

    // per utenti normali
    state.view = 'wizard';
    state.wizardStep = 1;
    render();
    if (result.savedToDataJson) {
      displayError('REGISTRAZIONE RIUSCITA! INIZIA LA CONFIGURAZIONE.');
    }
  }
},
```

### Why This Works
Now the flow is:
1. User registers → data created in data.json with all fields
2. `loadUserData()` is called → all fields loaded into `state` object
3. User enters wizard → makes changes
4. `saveAppState()` is called → preserves `createdBy` and `passwordHash` from `state`
5. Data is saved correctly with all fields intact

## Verification

### Tests Run
1. ✅ **test_login_fix.js** - All 7 tests passed
   - Verifies login functionality for users with and without passwordHash
   - Ensures password validation works correctly

2. ✅ **test_uid_fields.js** - All 4 tests passed
   - Verifies uid field is saved for all users
   - Verifies passwordHash is saved for all users
   - Verifies createdBy is saved for non-pro users
   - Verifies BASE_USER has correct structure

3. ✅ **test_auth_module.js** - All 6 tests passed
   - Verifies auth.js module structure
   - Ensures proper separation of concerns

4. ✅ **CodeQL Security Scan** - 0 vulnerabilities found
   - No security issues introduced by the change

### Manual Testing
A test page `test_wizard_fix.html` was created to verify the fix end-to-end:
1. Registers a test user
2. Simulates the wizard flow
3. Verifies all critical fields are preserved

## Impact Assessment

### What Changed
- **One line added**: `await loadUserData()` after registration
- **Location**: index.html, line 1030
- **Scope**: Minimal change with maximum impact

### What Didn't Change
- Registration logic in auth.js - unchanged
- Login flow - unchanged (already had loadUserData call)
- saveAppState logic - unchanged
- All other functionality - unchanged

### Benefits
1. ✅ User credentials are preserved during wizard flow
2. ✅ Creator tracking (createdBy) maintained for all users
3. ✅ Data consistency across the application
4. ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
5. ✅ Aligns registration flow with login flow (consistency)

## Data Flow Diagram

### Before Fix (BROKEN)
```
Registration
    ↓
Set state variables (uid, username, userType)
    ↓
Enter wizard (createdBy, passwordHash NOT in state)
    ↓
Wizard step: Add measurements
    ↓
saveAppState() tries to preserve createdBy, passwordHash
    ↓
❌ Fields are undefined in state → lost in data.json
```

### After Fix (WORKING)
```
Registration
    ↓
Set state variables (uid, username, userType)
    ↓
loadUserData() ← LOADS ALL FIELDS INTO STATE
    ↓
Enter wizard (createdBy, passwordHash IN state)
    ↓
Wizard step: Add measurements
    ↓
saveAppState() preserves createdBy, passwordHash from state
    ↓
✅ All fields preserved in data.json
```

## Backwards Compatibility

### Existing Users
- Users who already completed registration and wizard are unaffected
- Their data is already in data.json with all fields
- This fix only impacts NEW user registrations going forward

### Data Structure
No changes to data structure. The fix ensures the existing structure is properly maintained:
```json
{
  "uid": "unique_identifier",
  "userType": "user",
  "displayUsername": "USERNAME",
  "passwordHash": "hashed_password",
  "createdBy": "base_user_uid",
  "data": { ... },
  "sleepStartTimestamp": null,
  "createdAt": "timestamp"
}
```

## Conclusion

This minimal one-line fix resolves a critical data loss issue in the wizard flow by ensuring that all user fields are properly loaded into the state object before entering the wizard. The fix is:

- ✅ Minimal (one line change)
- ✅ Surgical (precise fix to the exact problem)
- ✅ Safe (no breaking changes)
- ✅ Tested (all tests pass)
- ✅ Secure (CodeQL scan passed)
- ✅ Consistent (aligns with existing login flow)

The issue is now fully resolved, and new users will maintain all their critical data fields throughout the wizard flow.
